## Introduction
Online Learning Management System has been designed and developed as part of Android Development Training. The System curates classroom content of the instructor and makes it available to the student. 

The data is stored into the system through the web interface. 

The instructors upload their content using the Teacher’s module. 

The student can see the content through their interface, which is an Android Application.

The major aim is to automate the classroom content sharing and provide a learning management system to students and teachers.

The complete report of student’s performance, content sharing system and inventory will be available to the teachers in the teacher module on web.

With the help of this module the teachers can share content with students and the content will be accessible by students.

####	Existing Systems v/s nexusUSICT
Existing systems that perform similar tasks are engrade.com, Google Classroom, courseoff.com etc. The common restriction among them is that the customisation is limited. Most of them are also not free for use and also provide a worn out interface. 
This system is open source and offer control to users, plethora of opportunities for developers(possibly students themselves) to contribute for the betterment of system continuously. 
Being open source, the system can be undertaken for redesign by institutions and can be modified as their requirements and specific use cases before deploying this system for their classroom, this makes this system deployable practically for any university and college.
